# Sample React App

This is a minimal React sample application that uses React and ReactDOM from CDNs and Babel in the browser to transpile JSX. No build tools or bundlers are required.

## How to run

1. Open `index.html` directly in your browser by double-clicking it, or
2. Serve it via a local HTTP server for best results:
   ```bash
   # Using Python 3
   python3 -m http.server 3000
   ```
   Then navigate to http://localhost:3000 in your browser.
